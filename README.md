# Offline Test Practice

This is a very simple web app made using Ionic

## Where?
Check it out at [https://offline-test-practice.herokuapp.com/](https://offline-test-practice.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose:
Students often practice for various competitive exams. While there are many online courses/test available, it is quite common for them to use a book to solve multi-choice questions/old test papers.

While practicing from books/hardcopy it gets difficult to keep track of progress - how many questions were right, how many were wrong, what could be my score? Some extra effort goes into maintaining this.

This application has all this inside!

## How?
* Select the no. of questions you are going to solve
* Select the options each question has (e.g. 4 means A,B,C,D)
* Enter the marks for every correct/incorrect answer
* Start!

**P.S.:** Yeah you might see too many commits mentioning 'Heroku'. That's because I didn't know how to deploy there, took me a while :p
